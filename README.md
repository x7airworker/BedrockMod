# BedrockMod
This is a modification/api for the Minecraft Bedrock Edition Server.  
The project is currently splitted into two parts:
- [BedrockModNative](./BedrockModNative) provides low level access to the server and launches a JVM by using JNI.
- [BedrockModJava](./BedrockModJava) provides a high level minecraft api to extend the server.
